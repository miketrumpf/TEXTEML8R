# TEXTEML8R

Not a good time to send your friend that text and you'll probably forget to send it later? Text'em L8R allows you to create and schedule texts to be sent out at a later time.  

How to use it?

1.  Create an Account
2.  Add Your Contacts.  Name and Number are the only necessary fields.  Number does not need spaces or dashes.
3.  Feel free to go to the contact view page to make sure that their information is correct.  Contacts can be edited or deleted.
4.  Once you have contacts, you can schedule texts to be sent out to them.  Click the send texts button.  Fill out the form with the date and time that you would like to send out the message.
5.  You can visit the scheduled texts page to see your texts.  Here you can see whether they have been successfully sent or not.  You can select to edit and delete texts on this page as well.  
Please note- This app utilizes the heroku scheduler add-on which checks the database every 10 minutes.  Due to this frequency, texts may not be sent out at the exact time specified.
